# ⚙️ Setting Up Python for Data Analysis in VS Code 

This guide walks you through installing Python and using VS Code for data analysis with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and Jupyter notebooks.

## 1️ - Install Python

### Step 1: Install Python 3

- Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install Python 3.10 or higher
- Make sure to **check the box** that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation

---

## 2️ - Install VS Code

- Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install it on your system

---

## 3️ - Install Required Python Packages

After installing Python, open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter
``` 
> **Note:** pip is the terminal command to install Python packages. You are installing pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), NumPy (for dealing with randomness and numbers), and matplotlib (for graphing). Any other packages and libraries can be installed with this command (It is Windows specific)


## 4 - VS Code Extensions

- In VS Code, there will be an extensions tab on the left, click on it.
-From here, install the Python Extension, and the Jupyter Notebook (may be called Jupyter)

## 5 Create or open a file
- All the setup is done now, so you can now make files
- I personally make a folder and then start creating files in VS Code after opening the empty folder
- For Python files, end the file with .py, e.g, main.py
- For Jupyter Notebooks, end it with ipynb, e.g, main.ipynb
> **Note:** VS Code will create the files based on how you name them, so if you don't add a file ending, it will just be a .txt file.
> **Note 2:** You will mainly be using ipynb files as they are much better for data manipulation due to being able to create cells instead of running the whole file at once

## Now you can start writing code
